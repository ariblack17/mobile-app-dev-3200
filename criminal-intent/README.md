# criminal-intent

Basic app which contains records of "office crimes," including information about each crime's title, date, and photo. 
The goal was to develop an app with flexible UI broken into fragments and to practice implementing large sets of data within
a recycler view.

Additional tweaks were made separately from Big Nerd Ranch's project description:
- changes were made so that DatePickerDialog navigates to the current date
- a cancel button was added to the Detail view, so that when a user is creating a new crime record, they are able to disregard their changes
- the launcher icon was changed to a custom design
